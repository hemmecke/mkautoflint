Installation instructions
=========================

mkautoflint does not itself provide any C source code. It simply
prepares the flint source tree to be compiled with the help of
autotools.

mkautoflint need flint as a subdirectory inside its tree. Say

  git clone http://selmer.warwick.ac.uk/flint2.git flint

or

  ln -s /path/to/your/flint/git/working/dir flint

In case you have a dirty flint directory, then first call

  cd flint
  git reset --hard   # reset your working directory to match HEAD
  git clean -df      # remove all files that are *not* in the git repo

but note that these commands are very dangerous, since they might
remove files that are important to you. It's always a good idea to
save your current status of your work into a git branch.

Then simply call

  ./mkautoflint.sh

The above script might install appropriate versions of autoconf,
automake, and libtools into a directory "autotools" of the mkautoflint
working directory.

Now compilation of flint is available with the usual commands.

  cd flint
  ./configure
  make
  make install

Type

  ./configure --help

to learn more about the options available.
In particular, you can specify the place of the MPIR and MPFR
directories via

  ./configure --with-mpir=/path/to/mpir --with-mpfr=/path/to/mpfr

For example, if mpir is installed in /opt/mpir/include and /opt/mpir/lib,
then you should call

  ./configure --with-mpir=/opt/mpir

mkautoflint does not currently support development of flint.
Actually, it does. One wouldn't have to re-execute the mkauto-flint.sh
script. It would be enough to modify the files inside the src or include
directories and rerun

  bash generate-rules.sh
  bash build-setup.sh

See mkautoflint.sh in case build-setup.sh asks you to install autotools.
