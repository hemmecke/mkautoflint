mkautoflint
===========

The project mkautoflint aims at providing autotools support for
compilation of the flint library (http://www.flintlib.org/).

It is written in the hope that some day the flint developers will
switch to autotools and thus make mkautoflint obsolete. Until then
mkautoflint will simply help users of flint to use the full power
of autotool by simply restructuring the flint source tree a bit and
providing configure.ac and Makefile.am and a script that generates
the list of files that is usually needed for automake.

Currently, there is only support to compile the flint library.
mkautoflint is still somewhat incomplete in the sense that it
does not yet support testing and profiling.
I hope (in the near future) to get all the current (original) flint
build options translated to be used with autotools.

In the hope that this project will be useful for someone...
